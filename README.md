# FaceOff Visuals project using WordPress and PHP

## Technologies Used

1. Javascript
2. CSS3
3. WordPress
4. PHP
5. HTML5


## Description 

This was my first real project using WordPress and PHP. It was a big learning curve as I have only exposed myself to mostly Javascript. Nevertheless I am proud of what I did. I will need to come back to this project in the future and structure the images better. There is no denying that the folder structure is a mess.

### Important Snippet of Code

Although not unusual for those who are accustomed to making wordpress themes. I did find it interesting on how you need to require BootStrap and other libraries and files in order for them to work in the WordPress Theme. I like the ease of of finding all CDN in one directory. Very COOL!
